### Face Mask Detection Using MobileNet

This project implements a face mask detection system using the MobileNet architecture for real-time classification. It efficiently determines whether individuals are wearing face masks with high accuracy and low computational cost. The repository includes code for training, evaluating, and deploying the model, along with instructions for setup and usage.
